        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p> (Not) Rubbish Robotics is a team of passionate engineers from The University of Edinburgh dedicated to creating practical Engineering learning opportunities for University students in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
        <img src="./images/group_photo_bayes.jpeg" alt="Group Photo in Bayes" width = 50% height = 50%>
        <p> We're on a mission to harness the untapped potential of electronic waste (e-waste) and use it as a catalyst for transformative change in the field of STEM education. Our diverse team brings together skills in robotics, mechanical and electrical engineering to create a sustainable solution that empowers students and communities in Sub-Saharan Africa and beyond.</p>
        </p>
        <p> 
        Specifically, we sought to build a robot completely out of e-waste, to prove that it is possible and inspire students to do the same.</p>

        <p>
        We chose to build a robot arm because it is a versatile tool that can be used to teach a wide range of subjects, including mechanics, electronics, and programming. We also wanted to build a robot arm because it is a tool that is used in industry, and we wanted to give students the opportunity to learn skills that would be useful in the workplace.

        <p> At (Not) Rubbish Robotics, our mission is clear: to revolutionize STEM education by repurposing discarded e-waste into functional robots. We're committed to tackling the challenges faced by students in developing countries, where access to quality education can be limited. Our goal is to make STEM education more accessible, hands-on, and engaging, ultimately contributing to improved social mobility and innovation.

        <h2>Educational Package</h2>
        <p> Our educational package, which includes a comprehensive instructions manual, can be used as a supplementary education tool for Engineering students in Sub-Saharan Africa.         </p>
        <p> We have included a parametric CAD model that allows users to customise their robot designs according to the motor dimensions in the e-waste they have found, and open-source code for controlling the robot.
        <p>
        <p>Head to our instructions page to find out how you can build your own!</p>
        <p>You will find instructions on how to disassemble a printer, characterise the e-waste, manufacture your robot and control it buttons from your printer or an arduino and code!</p>
